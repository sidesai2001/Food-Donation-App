# Food-Donation-App
This android-based Food Waste Management system can assist in collecting the leftover food from hotels & restaurants to distribute among those in need. NGOs that are helping poor communities to battle against starvation & malnutrition can raise a request for food supply from restaurants through this application. Once the request is accepted, the NGOs can collect the food from the restaurants for its distribution. In this way this android-based food waste management system will help restaurants to reduce food waste and will help in feeding the poor and needy people.
